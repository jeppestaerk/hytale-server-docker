# Hytale Downloader Configuration Directory
#
# Place your credentials.json file here for non-interactive authentication.
#
# To generate a credentials file:
# 1. Run the hytale-downloader locally once to complete OAuth
# 2. Copy the generated credentials file here
#
# Default credentials file location (local):
#   Linux: ~/.hytale-downloader-credentials.json
#   Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.hytale-downloader-credentials.json
#
# The file should be named: credentials.json
#
# With a credentials file, the container can download server files
# automatically without interactive OAuth authentication.
#
# SECURITY NOTE: Keep your credentials.json file secure and never
# commit it to version control!
